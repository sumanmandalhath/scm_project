Supply Chain Optimization for Leading US Pallets Manufacturer

Project Overview
This project aims to optimize the decision-making process for determining the number of pallets to be shipped to each customer. Previously, these decisions were made based on gut feeling, which led to inefficiencies. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we developed a data-driven approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the shipping process.

Business Problem
The primary challenge was to determine the optimal number of pallets to be shipped to major customers such as Amazon, Instakart, Flipkart, and HCCBPL. The previous method, based on gut feel, resulted in suboptimal shipping times and pallet counts.

Business Solution
We conducted a comprehensive data gathering process from various sources including research papers, articles, and datasets provided by the client. The collected data was preprocessed using various tools to ensure cleanliness and readiness for analysis.

Key Steps:
Data Gathering: Collected data from multiple sources including research papers, articles, and client datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis using Python libraries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA and descriptive statistics to uncover insights and trends.
Data Visualization: Utilized Python libraries to create graphical representations of the data.
Reporting: Synthesized findings into a concise report and developed a dynamic dashboard using Power BI, accessible through the Power BI online server.

Technology Stack
MySQL: For data storage and management.
Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Excel: For data manipulation and initial analysis.
Power BI: For creating and deploying interactive dashboards.

Business Benefits
Reduced Pallet Counting Time: By 90%, leading to significant time savings.
Reduced Shipping Time: By 15%, improving overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
